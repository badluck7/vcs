<p>Version control is a system that records changes 
    to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. - Grit</p>
    <br>

    <p>Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.[8] It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. 
        Its goals include speed,[9] data integrity,[10] and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. - Wikepidia</p>
